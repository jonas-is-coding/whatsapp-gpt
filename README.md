  # whatsapp-gpt-fix

## Introduction

This repository contains a forked and modified version of the original `whatsapp-gpt` project. The current version addresses two main issues I encountered while trying to run the project:

1. **Outdated Client Error** during WebSocket connection.
2. **Chatbot Integration:** Added a feature to interact with a local chatbot API.

## Issue 1: Outdated Client Error

When attempting to connect, the following error appeared:

```bash
10:09:20.723 [Client/Socket DEBUG] Dialing wss://web.whatsapp.com/ws/chat
10:09:20.975 [Client/Socket DEBUG] Frame websocket read pump starting 0x140001f24d0
10:09:23.120 [Client/Recv DEBUG] <failure location="cco" reason="405"/>
10:09:23.120 [Client ERROR] Client outdated (405) connect failure
10:09:23.121 [Client/QRChannel DEBUG] Closing channel with status {Event:err-client-outdated Error:<nil> Code: Timeout:0s}
Login event: err-client-outdated
10:09:23.122 [Client/Socket ERROR] Error reading from websocket: websocket: close 1006 (abnormal closure): unexpected EOF
```

### Solution

The issue is due to an outdated WhatsApp client. To fix this, upgrade your Go packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go get -u ./...
```

## Issue 2: Send Message Error

After addressing the outdated client error, I encountered a new issue related to sending messages using the latest version of the WhatsApp package. The code for sending a message was:

```bash
# command-line-arguments
./main.go:61:61: cannot use "" (untyped string constant) as *waE2E.Message value in argument to mycli.WAClient.SendMessage
./main.go:61:65: cannot use response (variable of type *waE2E.Message) as whatsmeow.SendRequestExtra value in argument to mycli.WAClient.SendMessage
```

This error is about this line in the code:
```go
mycli.WAClient.SendMessage(context.Background(), userJid, "", response)
```

### Solution

The newest version of the WhatsApp package introduced changes that required updating how messages are sent. The updated implementation now correctly handles sending messages and catching any errors that occur. This ensures that the bot can properly send responses back to users. So I just used the new syntax in the code and it worked:

```go
_, err = mycli.WAClient.SendMessage(context.Background(), userJid, response, whatsmeow.SendRequestExtra{})
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error sending message:", err)
        }
```
